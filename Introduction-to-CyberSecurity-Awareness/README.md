What I Learned

Topic 1 – What is Security Awareness?
I learned to think of security awareness as more than just policies — it’s about developing the habit of evaluating risk in everyday decisions. It helped me better categorize what counts as a high-risk behavior and how to approach digital safety in routine tasks.

Topic 2 – Being Socially Engineered
This section was a great reminder that attackers often prey on emotions and needs. It walked through how phishing emails target things like urgency, curiosity, or fear. I also saw how Maslow’s Hierarchy of Needs connects to manipulation tactics, which helped me understand the psychology behind social engineering better.

Topic 3 – Recognizing Malware
I reviewed some common myths — like thinking malware only comes from sketchy websites — and instead focused on the more subtle signs of infection. I now have a clearer distinction between obvious indicators and the more suspicious, borderline signs that something might be wrong on a system.

Topic 4 – Suspicious Activities
This part tied together physical and cyber security. It reminded me that not all threats are digital — tailgating into secure areas or unauthorized devices in the workplace can be just as dangerous. I also learned how to navigate uncertain situations with a security-first mindset, rather than ignoring something that “feels off.”

Reflection
Overall, this course sharpened my situational awareness and reminded me how valuable proactive reporting is. It reinforced that being part of a secure organization means knowing when to act — and doing so quickly and responsibly.
